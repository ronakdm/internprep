------------
The Internship Preparation Program aims to help students in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington find internships in industry.
The first program was organized by `Lang Liu <liu16@uw.edu>`_ and `Ronak Mehta <ronakdm@uw.edu>`_ in Autumn 2022.
We held a workshop to explain the overall process of internship applications and provide :doc:`resources` and tips for interviews.
We also conduct mock interviews and connect participants with stats alumni current working in industry.
