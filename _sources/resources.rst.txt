Coding
~~~~~~

A great website to practice coding exercises is `LeetCode <https://leetcode.com>`_.
There are three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard.
Most of the coding exercises in interviews will be roughly of the level easy and medium.
If you are new to coding exercises, we recommend that you start practicing by categories (e.g., array, string, etc.) using the "Tags" feature on the website.


Statistics and Machine Learning Basics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`StatQuest <https://www.youtube.com/c/joshstarmer>`_ is a Youtube channel with short videos reviewing basic statistics and machine learning concepts such as logistic regression and neural networks
The videos are of high quality with lots of graphical illustrations.


Quantitative Questions

In quantitative finance interviews, one type of questions that are not covered in tech interviews is the so-called quantitative questions.
These questions aim to test your quantitative abilities which only involves basics of mathematics, probability, statistics, and logic.
Two classical reference books are `Heard on the street: quantitative questions from Wall Street job interviews <https://www.amazon.com/Heard-Street-Quantitative-Questions-Interviews/dp/0994103867>`_ and `A Practical Guide To Quantitative Finance Interviews <https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Guide-Quantitative-Finance-Interviews/dp/1735028800/ref=pd_lpo_1?pd_rd_i=1735028800&psc=1>`_.
