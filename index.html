        <div class="under-text">Get Involved</div>
        <p>
          The Internship Preparation Program aims to help students in the
          Department of Statistics at the University of Washington find
          internships in industry. The first program was organized by <a href="https://langliu95.github.io/" target="_blank">Lang Liu</a>
          and Ronak Mehta in Autumn 2022. We held a workshop to explain the
          overall process of internship applications and provide Resources and
          tips for interviews. We also conduct mock interviews and connect
          participants with stats alumni current working in industry.

        <p>
          A great website to practice coding exercises is LeetCode. There are
          three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. Most of the coding
          exercises in interviews will be roughly of the level easy and medium.
          If you are new to coding exercises, we recommend that you start
          practicing by categories (e.g., array, string, etc.) using the “Tags”
          feature on the website.

          StatQuest is a Youtube channel with short videos reviewing basic
          statistics and machine learning concepts such as logistic regression
          and neural networks The videos are of high quality with lots of
          graphical illustrations.

        <div class="under-text">Quantitative Questions</div>
        <p>
          In quantitative finance interviews, one type of questions that are not
          covered in tech interviews is the so-called quantitative questions.
          These questions aim to test your quantitative abilities which only
          involves basics of mathematics, probability, statistics, and logic.
          Two classical reference books are Heard on the street: quantitative
          questions from Wall Street job interviews and A Practical Guide To
          Quantitative Finance Interviews.
