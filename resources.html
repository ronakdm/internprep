            <p>
                A great website to practice coding exercises is LeetCode. There are
                three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. Most of the coding
                exercises in interviews will be roughly of the level easy and medium.
                If you are new to coding exercises, we recommend that you start
                practicing by categories (e.g., array, string, etc.) using the “Tags”
                feature on the website.

            <p>
                In quantitative finance interviews, one type of questions that are not
                covered in tech interviews is the so-called quantitative questions.
                These questions aim to test your quantitative abilities which only
                involves basics of mathematics, probability, statistics, and logic.
                Two classical reference books are Heard on the street: quantitative
                questions from Wall Street job interviews and A Practical Guide To
                Quantitative Finance Interviews.
